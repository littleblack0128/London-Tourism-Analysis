# London-Tourism-Analysis
This project was performed for Deloitte to help understand what characteristics would lead tourists overstay their granted visa period.

The City of London’s local ministry is seeking advisory services regarding the following
issues:
1. What are the spending and visiting patterns of London’s tourists?
2. The difference between EU nations and non-EU nations on their spending and
visiting patterns in London.
3. What are the main factors that contributed to the tourists overstay?
4. Which tourists’ country of origins have the highest probabilities of overstay?

To address all the concerns, we decided to build a predictive model to find the solutions to
the above questions. We used R and Tableau to do the descriptive analysis to understand
and explore the given datasets. We employed Python to clean the datasets through various
feature engineering techniques and H2O to build models and measure the performance of
each model. The team found that the Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) learning model
with a balanced target variable performed the best with an AUC of 81.81%.
